**Final Project:**

**Project Description:** A complete data analytical approach is done on a wine dataset. All the concepts learnt in previews assignments are utilised to generate a valuable data analytical report. 
Initially the preprocessing of data is done. Here data cleaning and  exploratory data analysis is done to better understand the relationship between several variables within the dataset. This also helps in understanding about the individual nature of various parameters within a dataset. Various plotting techniques are done to understand the individual relationship between variables within the dataset.

**Clustering model:**
Clustering technique is used for identifying groups of data in the wine dataset. Black box effect is used to bring the data together. Data is divided into groups using K means clusering technique. This technique is used on several variables and their corresponding plots are obtained. Te value of K determines the number of groups that are formend within a dataset.

**Regression model:**
Regression model is used to establish relationship between multiple variables in the wine dataset. It is used to forecast the connection between dependent and independent predictors. Here the best sublet is used to provide an optimum relationship between several predictors. It selects the most elite model at every iteration. The R- square value is observed to determine the complexity of the model. the maximum R-square value obtained from the created regression models are 0.59.

**Classification model:**
These models are used to classify wine based on a variety of criteria. Here the wines are classified according to their qualtiy. Various models were created and their corresponding success rates were observed. A success rate of 61% was obtained on classifying the wine dataset based on their quality.
There was a 6 distintive quality in rate in the initial dataset.Inorder to improve the success rate of the classification model, the qualtiy of wine is grouped into 3 distinctive paramters. The success rates of the models were then increased to abou 87%.

**Cross-Validation:**
Cross-validation is a technique that is used to validate the various classification and regression model created. K-fold cross valdation technique is used to validate the model. The error range is represented by error bars. the error bars are plotted to visualise the acceptable error range. This is helpful to select the model with smaller standard error rate. Moreover, it is also used to determine the model with lower complexity. The error percentage in classifying wines are also visualised in the form of bar chart for clear understanding of the error rates.
